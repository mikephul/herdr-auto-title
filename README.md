A [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) plugin that names your tabs and panes after the
work in them. It reads the session twice a second, and it leaves alone any tab
or pane you rename yourself.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ada47ba7-cf64-405b-bc07-185dc10ef2ef

## Install

You need Herdr 0.8.2+ and Go 1.24+ on macOS, Linux or Windows. Herdr builds the
plugin from source when it installs it.

```sh
herdr plugin install kryptamine/herdr-auto-title
herdr plugin action invoke herdr.auto-title.restart
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Herdr starts plugins only when its server starts, so the second line starts
> this one now. Reopening the terminal attaches a new client to the same server
> and does not help; `herdr server stop` would work, at the cost of the session.

If you use Claude Code, also run `herdr integration install claude`. Without it,
a session you opened with a slash command and never prompted stays `claude`.

## What you get

```
~/work/dashboard                       →  1 · dashboard
~/work/dashboard on feature/MC-13200   →  2 · dashboard › MC-13200
nvim editing auth.provider.ts          →  3 · nvim › auth.provider.ts
an agent working on OAuth scopes       →  4 · dashboard › Implement OAuth scopes
ssh into prod-01                       →  5 · ssh › prod-01
mosh into devbox                       →  6 · mosh › devbox
$HOME                                  →  7 · Shell
```

- The number in front is the tab's position, which is also the key that
  switches to it.
- The default branch is left out. Other branches are cut down to what
  identifies them: `bugfix-asa-cpanel-uapi-mc-13675` becomes `MC-13675`.
- A tab with several panes is named after the focused pane, a pane with a busy
  agent, or the pane that changed last.
- Each pane gets a name of its own, so Herdr's goto panel (`prefix`+`g`) no
  longer lists every Claude Code pane as `claude`.
- Rename a tab or a pane yourself and Auto Title stops touching it. Clear the
  name to hand it back.
- The sidebar can say what each workspace is doing, under its name. Auto Title
  reports its active tab's topic -- what the agent or program there is working
  on, never the directory or the branch -- and leaves the workspace's name
  alone. Add a `$topic` row to Herdr's `config.toml` to see it:

  ```toml
  [ui.sidebar.spaces]
  rows = [["state_icon", "workspace"], ["$topic"]]
  ```

  A topic fades within a minute of Auto Title stopping or of
  `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_WORKSPACES=false`. A workspace name that an earlier Auto
  Title wrote, old task and all, stays until you rename or close the workspace.
- To rename workspaces from their active tab instead, set
  `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_RENAME_WORKSPACES=true` in `config.env` and restart Auto
  Title. Names include the project and omit the tab number, such as
  `dashboard › Fix login`. Existing custom names and later manual renames are
  protected. Clear a workspace name to hand it back to Auto Title.
  Renaming freezes Herdr's built-in directory naming; disabling the option
  leaves the last name in place. `$topic` reporting is independent, so set
  `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_WORKSPACES=false` if you only want workspace names.
- To show an open GitHub PR number, install and authenticate `gh` on the machine
  running Auto Title, then set `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_PR_NUMBERS=true` in `config.env`
  and restart it. A tab becomes `1 · [#663] trade › Fix login`; with workspace
  renaming enabled, its active workspace becomes `[#663] Fix login`. Without an
  open PR, the tab keeps its usual title and the workspace shows `Fix login`.
  Lookups are cached, and a failed lookup leaves the last known number in place.
- On Windows, Herdr reports only the shell or an agent running in a pane, so an
  editor or an ssh or mosh session does not name its tab.

> [!WARNING]
> The first start renames every pane, including panes you had already named by
> hand. A pane you rename after that is left alone.

## Configuration

Every setting is optional. Copy [`config.env.example`](config.env.example) to
`herdr-auto-title/config.env` in your configuration directory and uncomment
what you need. Auto Title looks in these, in order, and uses the first that
already holds the file:

| Order | Directory                                                        |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` when it is set to an absolute path            |
| 2     | `~/.config`, which is `%USERPROFILE%\.config` on Windows         |
| 3     | `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, `%APPDATA%` on Windows |

So `~/.config/herdr-auto-title/config.env` works on every platform, Windows
included, and one dotfiles repository serves every machine. A file already
sitting in `~/Library/Application Support` or `%APPDATA%` keeps being read
where it is.

Auto Title reads the file once at startup, so [restart it](#restarting) after a
change. It does not read the config directory that `herdr plugin list` prints.

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_DEBUG`        | `false`                                  | Log at DEBUG instead of INFO                                       |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_POLL_MS`      | `500`                                    | How often the session is read, in milliseconds                     |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH`   | `50`                                     | Longest title, in columns                                          |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_BRANCH_MAX`   | `12`                                     | Longest branch in a title, in columns; `0` hides branches          |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_POSITION`     | `true`                                   | Put the tab's position in front of its title                       |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_MANUAL_FILE`  | `manual-names.json`, found the same way  | Where names you set by hand are kept; empty keeps them in memory   |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_TRANSCRIPT`   | `true`                                   | Read Claude Code's transcript: what an agent is doing, and where     |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_AGENT_NAME`   | `false`                                  | Put the agent's name in front of what it is doing                  |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_PANES`        | `true`                                   | Name panes as well as tabs                                         |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_PREFER_AGENT` | `false`                                  | Name a tab after its agent pane even while another pane is focused |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_PANE_ID`      | `false`                                  | Put the pane's Herdr ID in front of its label, as `[w1:p2] api`    |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_PR_NUMBERS`   | `false`                                  | Prefix tab and workspace names with an open GitHub PR number        |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_WORKSPACES`   | `true`                                   | Report what each workspace's active tab is doing as its `topic`    |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_RENAME_WORKSPACES` | `false`                         | Rename workspaces from their active tab                           |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_WORKSPACE_MAX_LENGTH` | none: Herdr fits it              | Longest workspace name or topic, in columns                                          |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_CLAUDE_DIRS`  | none                                     | Extra Claude config homes to search, `:`-separated                 |

Turning `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_TRANSCRIPT` off also drops the branch from a tab whose
agent is working in a git worktree, because the transcript is what says which
worktree that is.

## Restarting

```sh
herdr plugin action invoke herdr.auto-title.restart
```

This starts a fresh Auto Title in place of the running one, and a notification
says how it went. Run it after upgrading, after changing the configuration, or
when the plugin has stopped naming tabs. To put it on a key, add to Herdr's
`config.toml`:

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "prefix+R"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "herdr.auto-title.restart"
description = "restart auto title"
```

That notification needs Herdr's toasts on. With `[ui.toast] delivery = "off"`
Herdr answers that it showed the notice, nothing appears, and the outcome is
left in `herdr plugin log list`.

Two limits. The first upgrade from a version without this action still needs
`herdr server stop`, because the instance already running does not know to
leave. On Windows the action needs Herdr 0.9.0 or newer.
