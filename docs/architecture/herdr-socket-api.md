# Herdr Socket API

Everything Auto Title knows about a session arrives over one local socket: a
Unix socket, or on Windows a named pipe. The originating specification is wrong
on several protocol details, so every fact below was verified against a live
**Herdr 0.8.2, protocol 20** install with `scripts/probe.py` or a direct socket
request, and the Windows facts against **0.8.2-preview, protocol 22**. **Probe
before assuming anything not listed here**, and record what a probe teaches you
in this file, which is the record. `AGENTS.md` carries the short list of facts
that would otherwise mislead the code in silence; a new one goes there too.

## Transport

Newline-delimited JSON over the socket named by `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`
(`internal/herdr/client.go`). A request is `{"id","method","params"}` — `params`
is required even when empty, which is why `emptyParams` exists in
`internal/herdr/protocol.go` — and a reply is `{"id","result"}` or
`{"id","error"}`.

**One request per connection.** Herdr closes the connection after answering, so
`SocketClient.Call` dials its own each time. That is not a workaround: it is why
there is no connection to lose and no reconnect logic anywhere in the plugin.
See [the poll loop](./poll-loop.md).

A malformed request is answered with an uncorrelated error frame, and the
connection is then closed.

**A call that gives up has not undone its request.** Once Herdr has read a
request it carries it out, even if the caller has since closed the connection.
A server stalled by a slow tab bar status command applied `tab.rename` requests
3 to 18 seconds after receiving them, well past the poll's deadline. So a
rename that got no answer may still land, which is why
[manual rename protection](./manual-rename-protection.md) keeps its label.
`Call` marks such a failure with `ErrUnanswered`, and only one that happened
after the request was sent: a dial that failed carried nothing to Herdr.

**On Windows the socket is a named pipe.** `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` still names a
file, `%APPDATA%\herdr\herdr.sock`, but that file is 25 bytes of text —
`<server pid>:<start time in ns>` — and not a socket: dialing it as a Unix
socket is refused, and Herdr listens instead on `\\.\pipe\` followed by the
whole path, drive letter and backslashes included. `dial_windows.go` opens that
pipe as a file. Opened so it takes no read deadline, but closing it from another
goroutine does unblock a pending read — measured on Go 1.24.0 and 1.26.3 — which
is what cancelling a call relies on. Framing and the one request per connection
are unchanged: one line comes back, then EOF. A `session.snapshot` of nineteen
panes measured 1.0 ms and 29 KB over the pipe, `pane.process_info` 1.0 ms.

## What Herdr gives a plugin process

A plugin the server starts inherits **the server's** environment, not the shell
of whoever installed it — which is why settings reach Auto Title through a file;
see [configuration](./configuration.md).

Alongside `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` and `HERDR_BIN_PATH`, the 0.8.2 binary names
`HERDR_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `HERDR_PLUGIN_CONFIG_DIR` and `HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR` for
a plugin process (and `HERDR_PLUGIN_ID`, `HERDR_PLUGIN_ENTRYPOINT_ID`,
`HERDR_PLUGIN_CONTEXT_JSON` with it). `herdr plugin config-dir <plugin id>`
prints the config directory, `herdr plugin list` repeats it, and Herdr creates
it empty at install time: `~/.config/herdr/plugins/config/herdr.auto-title/`
exists here.

> **Not observed live.** The variable names come from strings in the `herdr`
> 0.8.2 binary, not from the environment of a running plugin — seeing that needs
> `herdr server stop`, which closes the session. The directory and the two CLI
> commands were confirmed directly. Auto Title depends on none of it.

**A startup hook is run and forgotten.** In the Herdr source,
`start_plugin_command` (`src/app/api/plugins/runtime.rs`) spawns the command
and waits on it in a thread of its own, keeping no handle; server shutdown
(`complete_shutdown`, `src/server/headless/lifecycle.rs`) closes clients and
removes the socket files and touches no plugin process; and
`run_plugin_startup_hooks` runs from both server entry points
(`src/server/headless/bootstrap.rs`), a fresh start and a live handoff import.
What tells one server from the next is the socket file itself, the test Herdr
uses to decide whether a socket file is its own (`socket_file_identity`,
`src/ipc.rs`): on macOS and Linux the socket's device and inode, new with every
bind; on Windows the file's content, `<pid>:<unix nanoseconds>` written when
the pipe is bound. `Client.Server` reads it, and [the poll loop](./poll-loop.md)
leaves when it changes.

**Startup hooks run at no other time.** Read from the 0.9.0 source: install,
link, enable, a configuration reload and a client attaching run none of them,
and enable/disable only flip a flag in the registry. Nothing Herdr does short of
a server restart starts a plugin, which is what the restart action is for.

## Plugin actions

Read from the Herdr 0.9.0 source and confirmed on Windows 0.9.0 with a
throwaway plugin (link, invoke, unlink):

- **An action runs through `start_plugin_command`, like a startup hook,** with
  the same environment (`HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`, `HERDR_BIN_PATH`, the
  `HERDR_PLUGIN_*` set) plus `HERDR_PLUGIN_ACTION_ID`, in the plugin root.
  `herdr plugin action invoke <plugin id>.<action id>` runs one, and so does a
  keybinding of `type = "plugin_action"`; there is no command palette.
- **Its stdout and stderr are piped and read to EOF**, capped at 64 KB, and
  shown by `herdr plugin log list` once the command has finished. A process
  the action leaves behind must not inherit those pipes: it would keep the
  action "running" and hold one of the `MAX_PLUGIN_COMMANDS_IN_FLIGHT` (32)
  slots shared by every plugin for as long as it lived. A detached grandchild
  survives the action on every platform: Herdr keeps no process group of its
  own on macOS and Linux, and on Windows no job object, `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`
  being its only creation flag.
- **Duplicate action ids are rejected even with disjoint `platforms`**, so a
  Windows entry naming `herdr-auto-title.exe` beside a Unix one naming
  `herdr-auto-title` is not an option. On Windows Herdr turns `./x` into
  `<plugin root>\x` with no extension, and the Rust standard library's
  `resolve_exe` appends `.exe`: a manifest saying `["./probe", "hello"]` ran
  `probe.exe`, arriving as `argv[0]` `\\?\C:\...\probe`. That is why one
  extensionless entry serves every platform, and why the README asks Windows
  users for 0.9.0.
- **Actions whose `platforms` leave the OS out are listed and refused**
  (`platform_unsupported`), not hidden.
- **`HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR` is per plugin, not per session**, while the socket
  path is per session: `<config>/herdr.sock` for the default session and
  `<config>/sessions/<name>/herdr.sock` for a named one. Anything kept per
  session is therefore keyed by the socket path.

## Saved SSH machines

Measured on Herdr 0.9.1, protocol 22, with a macOS client and a Linux machine
saved through `herdr machine add`, both running Auto Title:

- **A saved machine's panes never reach the local socket.** The machine runs a
  Herdr server of its own — here the named session its profile points at,
  `<config>/sessions/<name>/herdr.sock` on the remote — and the TUI shows its
  workspaces by talking to that server. The local `session.snapshot` carried
  none of them, with the machine selected in the sidebar, and no field of any
  object in it names a machine or host. Workspace, tab and pane ids are scoped
  to one server, so the two sessions' `w1:p1` are different panes.
- **The machine's own Auto Title names those tabs**, started by the remote
  server's startup hook with the remote socket. It reads the remote session and
  the remote filesystem, which is where the agent's transcript is:
  `agent_session` is reported for a Claude pane there as it is locally, and the
  transcript it names exists in that machine's `~/.claude/projects/`. The
  topic reached the tab label, which is what the local sidebar then renders.
- **`cwd`, `foreground_cwd` and `terminal_title_stripped` are the remote's**,
  unaltered: a remote path, and for a plain shell the title the shell sets
  (`user@host: ~`). `pane.process_info` answers through
  `herdr --machine <label> pane process-info` with the remote processes and
  their remote `cwd`, as locally.

So a saved machine needs no handling in the plugin: a pane on one is local to
the only Auto Title that sees it. A machine without Auto Title installed keeps
whatever labels it has; the local instance cannot see it to name it.

## The methods Auto Title uses

Seven, and no others (`internal/herdr/client.go`), `workspace.rename` only
when workspace renaming is enabled, and `workspace.report_metadata`
unless workspace topics are turned off:

- **`session.snapshot`** returns the whole session — every tab with its label,
  every pane with its directory, terminal title, agent and agent status.
  Measured at 0.47 ms and 6 KB for six panes.
- **`pane.process_info`** returns what is running in one pane. Measured at
  0.11 ms — less than the snapshot itself, because it reads the process table
  rather than serializing the session. It is one request *per pane* though, so
  a poll that asks about every pane pays for the cheapness several times over:
  on an eight-pane session the reads measured 0.17 ms each against a 1.35 ms
  snapshot, which is as much again as the snapshot they follow. Its
  `foreground_processes` holds the pane's foreground process *and that
  process's descendants*, each with `name` and a nullable `argv`. **A pane's
  revision does not track that list**: over ten minutes of a live eight-pane
  session the processes changed nine times and the revision moved with them
  four, one pane going `env` → `node` → `esbuild` → `fish` with its revision
  held at 10. A revision reports that the pane drew, nothing more.
- **`tab.rename`** takes `{tab_id, label}`. Measured at 0.16 ms median and
  0.21 ms at p95 over forty calls, against 0.99 ms for the `session.snapshot`
  preceding them. Renaming is not what limits anything.
- **`pane.rename`** takes `{pane_id, label}` and answers with the pane. It is
  what Herdr's goto panel lists a pane by: that panel falls back through the
  pane's label, the agent's name, its display name, its title and finally
  `pane N`, so a session of Claude Code panes reads as a column of `claude`
  until something sets a label. Auto Title uses it unless pane naming is turned
  off — see [configuration](./configuration.md).
- **`notification.show`** takes `{title, body, position, sound}`, `title`
  required and the rest optional, and answers
  `{type: "notification_show", shown, reason}` with `reason` one of `shown`,
  `disabled`, `rate_limited`, `no_foreground_client` and `busy` — a notice
  that was not shown is still a success. Sent over the pipe on Windows 0.9.0:
  `{"title": "Auto Title probe", "body": "..."}` answered
  `{"shown": true, "reason": "shown"}`. From the source: nothing is shown
  without a client attached, two within a second is one too many, and the only
  error is `invalid_params` for an empty title. Only the restart action uses
  it, to say how the restart went. **`shown` is not delivery.** With
  `[ui.toast] delivery = "off"` in `config.toml` — one of `off`, `herdr`,
  `terminal`, `system` — Herdr 0.9.0 still answers `{"shown": true, "reason":
  "shown"}` and the user sees nothing, so the action's log is the only place
  its outcome can be read.

- **`workspace.rename`** takes `{workspace_id, label}` and replaces the
  workspace label when renaming is enabled. The call freezes Herdr's automatic
  directory naming; the plugin protects manual labels separately.
- **`workspace.report_metadata`** takes `{workspace_id, source, tokens,
  ttl_ms}`. Auto Title reports one token, `topic`, under the source
  `herdr.auto-title`, and does not itself rename a workspace: see what the call does
  [below](#what-the-objects-carry) and when it is made in
  [the poll loop](./poll-loop.md#the-workspace-topic).

A label is **one line**. `tab.rename` accepts a newline and stores it verbatim,
with no error and no stripping, but the tab bar renders a single line and Herdr
exposes no setting for its height. Anything a title has to say fits on one row
or does not get said.

`tab.get` and `pane.get` read one object each, and `pane.list` filters by
workspace only, never by tab. None of them is needed while the snapshot is one
call.

## Why the event stream is not used

Herdr does expose an event stream, and Auto Title deliberately ignores it.

**On subscribe, Herdr replays a backlog before delivering anything live**:
roughly the last 95 revisions of every pane, paced at about ten a second, so
around ten seconds of history for each active pane, closed panes included. Live
events queue behind that — a change made two seconds after subscribing was
observed arriving thirteen seconds later.

There is no way to skip it. `events.subscribe` takes only a subscription list,
event envelopes carry no timestamp or sequence number, and no method exposes a
stream position. A subscriber therefore spends its first seconds reacting to a
session that no longer exists, while a snapshot always describes the present.

**Do not reintroduce a subscription** without measuring again and recording the
result here.

Two further traps, if anyone does: subscription types use dot notation
(`pane.updated`) while the events they deliver arrive with snake_case kinds
(`pane_updated`), wrapped as `{"event": ..., "data": ...}`; and
`pane.output_changed` is a real event kind but is **not** an accepted
subscription type. `pane.agent_status_changed`, `pane.scroll_changed` and
`pane.output_matched` are per-pane and rejected without a `pane_id`, while
`pane.agent_detected` is global. `pane_closed` and `pane_agent_detected` carry
only pane identifiers — neither names the tab.

## What the objects carry

The wire types in `internal/herdr/session.go` mirror only the fields the code
reads, so this section describes Herdr rather than those types.

- **Pane revisions are monotonic per pane.** That is how one poll tells which
  panes moved since the last, and it is the whole basis of
  `internal/state/changes.go` and of the process reads `internal/reads` reuses.
- **`PaneInfo.cwd` is the pane's own shell, not what the user is typing into.**
  A subshell moves `foreground_cwd` and leaves `cwd` behind: probed with
  `chezmoi cd`, which runs `$SHELL` in the source directory, the pane reported
  `cwd: ~/Work/global-sso` and `foreground_cwd: ~/.local/share/chezmoi` for as
  long as that subshell lived, while `pane.process_info` listed the subshell
  alone. Both fields are null when Herdr cannot read one, and neither is the
  pane's directory on its own — see the two facts below and
  [title resolution](./title-resolution.md).
- **`foreground_cwd` is the deepest descendant's, not the foreground process's
  own.** Probed with a pane in `~/Library/Application Support/herdr-auto-title`
  running `python3` that had spawned `sleep` in `/tmp`: `cwd` reported the
  pane's directory, `foreground_cwd` reported `/private/tmp`, and
  `pane.process_info` listed the child first and its parent second. Anything a
  program starts elsewhere takes the pane's directory with it.
- **A pane's directory is the `cwd` of its own foreground process**, which only
  `pane.process_info` reports. Probed across the four panes of a live session:
  in every one the last entry of `foreground_processes` was the process whose
  `pid` equals `foreground_process_group_id`, and its `cwd` was the directory
  the pane was working in. The order is not the same everywhere: Herdr 0.9.0
  on Linux lists the foreground process first and its descendants after it,
  so `herdr.PaneProcesses` finds it by that `pid` and moves it last rather
  than trusting its place. One pane disagreed with both snapshot fields at once
  — `cwd: ~/Work/herdr-auto-title` (the shell it was started from) against
  `foreground_cwd: ~/Work/self-care-portal` (an MCP server), with the agent
  itself in `~/Work/self-care-portal`. Auto Title reads it for the pane that
  names the tab and keeps the snapshot's pair behind it — see
  [title resolution](./title-resolution.md).
- **`foreground_processes` is the pane's foreground process group.** Every
  process it listed shared the group id `pane.process_info` reports as
  `foreground_process_group_id` and the pane's controlling terminal; a
  descendant started in a group of its own without a terminal — which is how
  Claude Code runs the commands it is asked to run — was absent from the list
  while it ran. An agent's MCP servers are in it, and so is what Claude Code
  starts on its own: an `ssh -T git@github.com` check and a `git fetch` of a
  plugin marketplace over ssh were both listed, before the agent itself.
- **`pane.process_info` reports more per process than a name.** Each entry
  carries `pid`, `argv0`, `cmdline` and `cwd` beside `name` and `argv`, and the
  pane's entry carries `shell_pid` and `foreground_process_group_id`. Auto
  Title reads the name, the arguments, the directory, and the `pid` matched
  against `foreground_process_group_id`; the rest is listed here so a future
  change need not probe again.
- **A zombie stays in `foreground_processes`, with only a `pid` and a `name`.**
  Herdr reads no `argv` from a process in state `D`, `Z` or `X`, and a zombie
  has no `cwd`. Probed on 0.9.1 on Linux: in fish,
  `status job-control none; sleep 1 & disown` kept `sleep` listed until the next
  command. `state.ProcessesFrom` drops an entry with neither field, since a
  process in disk wait keeps its `cwd`. On macOS Herdr leaves the zombie out,
  and a process owned by root too: `sudo` waiting for a password is not listed.
- **On Windows, `foreground_processes` holds the pane's shell or a recognized
  agent, and nothing else.** Probed with `python.exe` and then `node.exe`
  running under a pane's `pwsh.exe`, both confirmed present in the process tree:
  the list held `pwsh.exe` alone, while a Claude Code pane listed `claude.exe`
  alone. Windows has no foreground process group, and Herdr's detection there
  scans for agents and known wrappers rather than reading one. The process and
  ssh sources therefore go quiet on Windows; the directory read still holds,
  because Herdr's pwsh prompt hook keeps the shell's own directory current —
  `Set-Location C:\Windows` moved both `cwd` and the process's `cwd` within one
  prompt. Names carry `.exe`, a process's `cwd` carries a trailing backslash
  (`C:\github\x\`), and `foreground_cwd` was null on every pane.
- **A Windows pane whose program has set no title carries `pwsh in <dir>`**,
  the shell and the basename of its directory, `pwsh in Windows` after the
  `Set-Location` above. It is Herdr's own fallback, and the resolver refuses it
  the way it refuses a shell prompt.
- **`PaneInfo` carries no foreground process name.** Only `pane.process_info`
  answers that, and nothing announces that a command started.
- **`PaneInfo.title` is the agent's own title**, not the terminal's. Herdr left
  it null for every Claude Code pane observed; that agent reports its topic
  through `terminal_title_stripped` instead. This is why most agent context
  reaches a title one rung below the agent source — see
  [title resolution](./title-resolution.md).
- **`PaneInfo.agent_session` says which conversation the pane's agent holds**,
  and it is null until an agent's integration reports one.
  `herdr integration install <agent>` installs the hook that does — Herdr ships
  one for seventeen agents, Claude Code among them, and `herdr integration
  status` lists them with the path each is written to. The Claude hook runs on
  `SessionStart` and calls `pane.report_agent_session` with the session id and
  the transcript path; Herdr keeps only the id, answering `kind: "id"` even when
  both were reported, so a reader that wants the file finds it by id. Auto Title
  reads it from the snapshot — no extra request — and what it does with it is in
  [title resolution](./title-resolution.md).
- **`pane.report_metadata` is how anything outside Herdr sets `PaneInfo.title`.**
  Probed directly: `herdr pane report-metadata <pane> --source X --title T` put
  `T` in the snapshot's `title` and a tab bearing it appeared within one poll;
  `--clear-title` undid it. Nothing installs a source for it today, which is why
  `title` is null in practice. It also carries `--display-agent`,
  `--state-label`, `--token` and a `--ttl-ms`.
- **A workspace object carries** `workspace_id`, `number`, `label`, `focused`,
  `pane_count`, `tab_count`, `active_tab_id` and `agent_status`, plus `tokens`
  only while metadata is reported on it and `worktree` for a workspace in a git
  worktree. `active_tab_id` is the tab the workspace shows: a second tab
  created with `--no-focus` left it on the first. `TabInfo.focused` is not that
  tab — it was false for both tabs of that workspace, since it marks only the
  one tab a client is looking at.
- **`workspace.report_metadata` attaches display-only tokens to a workspace and
  never touches its label.** It takes `{workspace_id, source, tokens}` plus an
  optional `seq` and `ttl_ms`, with `tokens` a required map from name to a
  string or `null`: `null` clears, and there is no `clear_tokens` field — an
  unknown field is ignored rather than refused. Probed on 0.9.1 with a
  temporary workspace: the source `herdr.auto-title` was accepted; a second
  token from the same source merged beside the first; `null` for a token the
  workspace did not carry was accepted; `""` was accepted and stored nothing; a
  600-character value was stored cut to 80. A token reported with
  `ttl_ms: 2000` was gone three seconds later, and re-reporting the same value
  before it expired postponed the expiry. **A token is keyed by its name
  alone, whichever source reports it**: with `topic` set to `one` by one source,
  a second source's `two` replaced it, that second source's `null` then left no
  `topic` at all rather than `one`, and its `null` also cleared a `topic` only
  the first had set. The snapshot returns that one flat map, with neither source
  nor expiry. A closed workspace answers `workspace_not_found`, and `ttl_ms`
  must lie in 1..86400000. A `$name` entry in `ui.sidebar.spaces.rows` draws a
  token.
- **`agent_status` is `idle | working | blocked | done | unknown`.** Every pane
  carries one, and a pane with no agent reports `unknown`. `TabInfo` carries one
  as well, aggregated over the tab's panes: with a single Claude Code pane
  working, its tab reported `working` while every other tab reported `unknown`.
  How it aggregates two agent panes in one tab has not been probed.
- **A workspace nobody has renamed is labelled after its pane's directory, and
  the label follows that directory until anything renames it.** Probed:
  `herdr workspace create --no-focus --cwd /tmp` answered `label: "tmp"` with
  `number: 3`, while the tab created inside it answered `label: "1"`, so the
  trap below is a tab's alone — a workspace never wears its position. On 0.9.1
  the label then followed the shell: a workspace created in `alpha-dir` read
  `beta-dir`, then `gamma-dir`, as its shell `cd`'d there, with nothing renaming
  it. Any rename stops that. Renamed to `Named`, it stayed `Named` across a
  `cd`; renamed to `""`, it read `""` and kept it — an empty rename does not
  hand the label back.
- **`TabInfo.number` is not the label an unnamed tab carries.** `number` counts
  every tab its workspace has ever held and never repeats — a workspace holding
  six tabs was seen numbering them 2, 9, 30, 33, 35, 36. The label Herdr puts on
  a tab nobody has named is its *position* in the workspace, counted from one,
  and it slides down whenever a tab to the left of it closes: three fresh tabs
  labelled `5`, `6`, `7` became `5`, `6` when the middle one was closed. Tabs
  arrive from `session.snapshot` in the order they are shown, so the position is
  the count of the workspace's tabs up to and including that one.

  Reading `number` as the default label locked every tab created after startup;
  the story is in [manual rename protection](./manual-rename-protection.md).
- **A tab has two unnamed shapes, and only one of them is the position.** A tab
  nobody has named reports its position (`herdr tab create` in a four-tab
  workspace answered `label: "5"`), but clearing a name stores exactly what it
  was given: `herdr tab rename wG:tS ""` answered `label: ""`, and the snapshot
  reported the same. The tab bar shows the position for both. Anything reading
  the label to mean "unnamed" has to accept the empty string as well.
- **A pane's label is absent from the wire until the pane has one.** Across a
  seven-pane session no pane object carried `label` in `session.snapshot`,
  `pane.get` or `pane.list`; renaming one made the key appear in all three, and
  clearing it made the key vanish again. It decodes to `""`, which is the one
  thing an absent label can mean — and reading it back is what makes protecting
  a manual pane rename possible at all.
- **A pane has one unnamed shape where a tab has two.** `pane.rename` *clears*
  an empty label rather than storing it: both `{"pane_id": p}` with no label and
  `{"pane_id": p, "label": ""}` answered with the `label` key gone. So clearing
  a pane's name is the whole of the gesture that hands it back, and there is no
  position spelling to accept beside it.
- **A pane moved to another workspace takes a new id and keeps its label.** On
  0.9.0-preview, `herdr pane move --new-tab` kept `wW5:p2` as it was; then
  `--new-workspace` made it `wW7:p1`, and `--new-tab --workspace wW5` made it
  `wW5:p3` rather than handing back `p2`. The label rode along each time, and
  `session.snapshot` no longer listed the old id. So a pane first seen wearing a
  label is not necessarily one its owner just named; see
  [manual-rename-protection.md](manual-rename-protection.md).
- **Nothing moves a tab or a workspace under a new id.** `tab.move` takes a
  `tab_id` and an `insert_index` and reorders within the tab's workspace,
  ignoring any other field; `workspace.move` reorders the workspace list. Both
  kept the id, and neither CLI offers a move.

## Workspace rename probe on 0.9.3

On Herdr 0.9.3, protocol 22, `workspace.rename` accepted
`{workspace_id, label}` over the socket and returned a `workspace_info` result.
A temporary workspace created without focus in `/tmp` initially carried the
label `tmp`; sending `auto-title rename probe` changed the label returned by
`workspace.get` to exactly that string. The workspace was then closed. Auto
Title calls this method only with workspace renaming enabled.
